.. note::

  This project is under active development!

  If you would like to contribute, please submit an issue or pull request to our `GitHub repo <https://github.com/FTC-Goodies/All-Goodies>`_.

The site is intended to be a comprehensive list of curated resources for FTC teams of all skill levels. The site does not contain any information of its own (except for brief primer information about each topic). Instead, many links are provided to other resources that contain the relevant information.

.. note::

  This is not an official site! It has been put together by community members who have found these resources to be incredibly helpful. We have done our best to evaluate each resource, however since we have no control over them, it's possible that some contain incorrect information, or inappropriate content.
